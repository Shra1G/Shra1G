# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shravan — but you can call me G!  

I'm a **Software Development Engineer at <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Target_logo.svg" height="60" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 3px;"/>** and an alumnus of **IIT (BHU), Varanasi**.  

I enjoy building scalable products and experimenting with tech that makes life simpler.  
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me at the gym 🏋️, playing badminton 🏸, swimming 🏊, or diving deep into topics like **psychology, finance, and film** 🎬 — preferably with a **caffè mocha ☕** in hand.
